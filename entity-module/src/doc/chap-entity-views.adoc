[[entity-views]]
== Entity views
EntityModule has the ability to generate automatic views for entities.
When AdminWebModule is present, automatic CRUD pages for entities will be generated using these views.

A view is an abstraction of web controller that allows you to take advantage of the EntityModule configuration system.
Usually views are a rendering of one or more entities of a particular entity type.

Both `EntityConfiguration` and `EntityAssociation` can have their own views defined.
They do so by implementing the `EntityViewRegistry` interface.
Every view has a unique name within an `EntityViewRegistry`.

=== Default views
By default CRUD views will be created for every `EntityConfiguration with a `CrudRepository` or an `EntityQueryExecutor` registered.
Likewise CRUD views will be created for every `EntityAssociation` with an `AssociatedEntityQueryExecutor` attribute.

NOTE: Query executor attributes should be registered automatically in most cases.
So you usually don't need to worry about those.
See the <<entity-query-executor,chapter on `EntityQueryExecutor`>> for more information.

The following default views will be created for an entity type:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|===

|View name
|View type
|Description

|listView
(`EntityView.LIST_VIEW_NAME`)
|list view
|Shows the list of entities.

|createView
(`EntityView.CREATE_VIEW_NAME`)
|form view
|Renders and executes the form for creating a new entity.

|updateView
(`EntityView.UPDATE_VIEW_NAME`)
|form view
|Renders and executes the form for updating an entity.

|deleteView
(`EntityView.DELETE_VIEW_NAME`)
|form view
|Shows the confirmation page and performs the delete if allowed.

|===

The default views all render markup using the `ViewElement` infrastructure and the implementations provided by the BootstrapUiModule.

=== How entity views work
An `EntityView` is created by an `EntityViewFactory` based on an `EntityViewRequest`.
A controller is still responsible for executing (usually rendering) the actual `EntityView`.

The `GenericEntityViewController` is responsible for loading and rendering all default views in the AdminWebModule UI.

The path of the web request to `GenericEntityViewController` will determine:
* the name of the view that should be rendered
* which `EntityViewRegistry` will be used for loading the view (`EntityConfiguration` or `EntityAssociation`)

NOTE: You can force the view being rendered by simply providing the view name as a request parameter with key *view*.

The controller creates an `EntityViewRequest`, retrieves the `EntityViewFactory` and builds the corresponding `EntityViewContext` and `EntityViewCommand`.

==== EntityViewRequest
Wraps together all the information of a specific entity view request:

 * the web request that is creating the view
 * the contextual information of the entity being viewed (represented by the `EntityViewContext`)
 * the command that should be executed on the `EntityViewFactory` (represented by the `EntityViewCommand`)
 * the name of the view being requested and the `EntityViewFactory` being used
 * the `PageContentStructure` of the page being rendered (if applicable)

Please refer to the {javadoc}/com/foreach/across/modules/entity/views/request/EntityViewRequest.html/[`EntityViewRequest` javadoc] for a description of all available properties.

==== EntityViewContext
The `EntityViewContext` contains contextual information and provides access to components that should be used for building a view.
Contextual information is for example the entity type, specific entity or entity association being viewed.
Components are things like the `EntityLinkBuilder`, `EntityMessages` or `AllowableActions`

Please refer to the {javadoc}/com/foreach/across/modules/entity/views/context/EntityViewContext.html/[`EntityViewContext` javadoc] for a description of all available properties.

NOTE: `EntityViewContext` is available as a request-scoped bean but only in case of a request passing through the `GenericEntityViewController` will the data be loaded.
Loading the `EntityViewContext` attributes manually  can be done by using the `EntityViewContextLoader` bean.
You should use the `ConfigurableEntityViewContext` interface to modify a view context.

==== EntityViewCommand
The `EntityViewCommand` represents the command that should be executed on the `EntityViewFactory` to create the corresponding `EntityView`.
Most often the command represents the form of a view where the request parameters are bound to.

An `EntityViewCommand` has 2 attributes: the (optional) entity DTO being bound and a map of named extensions.
Customizing view processing can be done by registering additional extensions that will be rendered and validated upon binding.

The `EntityViewCommand` will be validated for every state modifying request: web requests using POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE.

Please refer to the {javadoc}/com/foreach/across/modules/entity/views/request/EntityViewCommand.html/[`EntityViewCommand` javadoc] for a description of all available properties.

==== EntityViewFactory
Every view is built by an `EntityViewFactory`.
An `EntityViewRegistry` (like `EntityConfiguration` or `EntiyAssociation`) is nothing but a map of `EntityViewFactory` by view name.

An `EntityViewFactory` is a stateless controller with 4 controller methods that are expected to be called in a specific order.
Please refer to the {javadoc}/com/foreach/across/modules/entity/views/EntityViewFactory.html[javadoc] for an overview of the different controller methods and their purpose.

===== DispatchingEntityViewFactory and EntityViewProcessor
EntityModule has only a single implementation of `EntityViewFactory` in the form of the `DefaultEntityViewFactory`.
The `DefaultEntityViewFactory`:

* supports `ViewElement` based rendering model - heavily used by EntityModule for building the HTML markup
* dispatches its controller methods in a more fine-grained manner to a list of registered and ordered `EntityViewProcessor` instances.

The default builders when <<configuring-views,configuring views>> only register `EntityViewProcessor` beans on the factory.
When an `EntityViewFactory` controller method is being called, it will be translated into one or more processor methods and those method calls will be dispatched to all processors in order.

Two adapter `EntityViewProcessor` classes are available:

* use `EntityViewProcessorAdapter` for most use cases, it provides several adapter methods that also allow you to hook into the `ViewElement` generation lifecycle
* use `SimpleEntityViewProcessorAdapter` if you do not need to hook into the `ViewElement` generation lifecycle

NOTE: The `DefaultEntityViewFactory` will not execute any of the rendering related methods if any of the previous methods has marked the `EntityView` as being a redirect.

Please refer to the {javadoc}/com/foreach/across/modules/entity/views/EntityViewProcessor.html[EntityViewProcessor], {javadoc}/com/foreach/across/modules/entity/views/processors/EntityViewProcessorAdapter.html[EntityViewProcessorAdapter] and {javadoc}/com/foreach/across/modules/entity/views/processors/SimpleEntityViewProcessorAdapter.html[SimpleEntityViewProcessorAdapter] for more details on the available processor methods.
The appendix also provides a <<appendix-view-processors,list of all available general purpose processors>>.

==== Model attributes
The `GenericEntityViewController` exposes the following model attributes to the Spring MVC view:

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|Attribute name
|Value

|*entityViewRequest*
|`EntityViewRequest`

|*entityViewCommand*
|`EntityViewCommand`

|*entityViewContext*
|`EntityViewContext`

|===

=== Default view types
EntityModule supports 3 view types by default.

When defining a new view (see the next section) it will be one of these types.
The view type determines the base template that will be used to setup the `EntityViewFactory`.

The following view types are defined:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|===

|View type
|Template name
|Description

|list view
|listView
(`EntityView.LIST_VIEW_NAME`)
|Base configuration for rendering a list of entities.

|form view
|updateView
(`EntityView.UPDATE_VIEW_NAME`)
|Base configuration for rendering a form for a single entity.

|generic view
|genericView
(`EntityView.GENERIC_VIEW_NAME`)
|Barebone configuration for visualizing a single entity.

|===

The template name can be used to replace the initializer for the `EntityViewFactoryBuilder`.
See the chapter on the <<view-builder-initializer,EntityViewFactoryBuilderInitializer>>.

See also the next chapters for more information on <<list-view,list view>>, <<form-view,form view>> and <<generic-view,generic view>>.

[[configuring-views]]
=== Configuring views
Existing views can be modified or new ones registered using an `EntityViewFactoryBuilder` or `EntityListViewFactoryBuilder`.
You usually don't create these manually but get a builder for the corresponding view from the configuration or association builder.

The builders provide common properties that will configure one or more `EntityViewProcessor` instances on the view factory.
They also allow you to modify the processor collection directly by adding or removing processors, or by post-processing the entire `EntityViewProcessorRegistry`.

.Example adding an EntityViewProcessor to the default list view
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
configuration.withType( MyEntity.class )
             .listView( lvb -> lvb.viewProcessor( myProcessor ) );
----

The following chapters provide some more details on how to configure the default view types.
